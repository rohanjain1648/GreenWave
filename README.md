# GreenWave 🌊🚦

> **A real-time AI digital twin that proves smarter traffic signals save lives, time, and the planet — live, in 3D, in your browser.**

Two identical city districts run side by side. One is controlled by the same fixed timers most cities have used since the 1970s. The other is run by **GreenWave's AI**. Both receive the exact same vehicles from the same random seed. Every second you watch, the AI measurably outperforms the baseline — and every disruption you inject widens the gap further.

## The Problem

Urban traffic signals are one of the most consequential, most neglected pieces of infrastructure in the world:

- **54 billion hours** of commuter time are lost annually to traffic congestion in the US alone.
- The average urban driver spends **~50 extra hours per year** sitting at red lights with no cross-traffic.
- Idling and stop-and-go driving accounts for a disproportionate share of **vehicle CO₂ emissions** — fuel burned while going nowhere.
- Emergency vehicles lose an average of **1–3 minutes per mile** to red lights. For cardiac arrest, every minute reduces survival odds by ~10%.
- City planners have **no safe sandbox** to test changes. Every experiment happens on a live city with real commuters.

The root cause: signals are still timed to a fixed schedule written once, decades ago, based on traffic surveys that are immediately out of date. They don't know what's actually on the road right now.

---

## The Solution

GreenWave runs a live simulation of a city district and replaces fixed timing with **Max-Pressure adaptive control** — a decentralized, mathematically proven signal policy that reads actual queue lengths at each intersection and allocates green time to where demand is highest. No training data needed. No black box. Citable in the traffic engineering literature.

On top of that: **transit signal priority** — when an ambulance enters the network, GreenWave detects it on each approach and pre-empts the signal green before it arrives, opening a corridor through the city. The fixed city makes it wait at every red.

The whole thing runs **live in your browser** with a 3D rendered city, real-time KPIs, and interactive disruptions you can inject while it runs.

---

## Verified Results

These numbers come from a headless 1000-second benchmark run (accident injected at t=400s, demand multiplier 1.0):

| Metric | Fixed Timing | GreenWave AI | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Avg trip time | 121.8 s | 66.8 s | **45% faster** |
| Total wait time | 72,425 s | 13,966 s | **81% less idle time** |
| Trips completed | 1,237 | 1,433 | **+16% throughput** |
| Mean queue length | 0.53 veh | 0.05 veh | **91% shorter queues** |
| CO₂ emitted | 275 kg | 201 kg | **27% less emissions** |
| Ambulance: travel time | 133.5 s | 111.0 s | **17% faster response** |
| Ambulance: stops | 3 | **0** | never stopped at a red |

*Numbers vary with the live scenario you create in the UI — inject accidents and surges to widen the gap further.*

## Features

### Core Simulation
- **Spatial-queue traffic micro-simulation** — vehicles travel along directed edges, queue at stop lines, discharge at green phases via a saturation flow model. Pure Python, no SUMO, no NumPy, no external API keys.
- **Deterministic demand** — both twins receive the same Poisson-distributed vehicle demand stream from a shared seeded RNG (seed=42). The comparison is a fair counterfactual, not cherry-picked.
- **45% central-avenue bias** — asymmetric demand (like a real city's main artery) is exactly where adaptive control beats fixed timing most.
- **Emissions model** — CO₂ accumulates per second of motion (1.6 g/s), idling (0.9 g/s), and per stop-and-go event (8 g penalty for acceleration). A network that flows better is measurably cleaner.

### AI Controller: Max-Pressure
- At every intersection, every tick, compute the **pressure** of each signal phase:
  `pressure = (halted vehicles upstream) − 0.5 × (halted vehicles downstream)`
- Give green to whichever phase has higher pressure.
- **Hysteresis** (0.5 veh threshold) prevents signal flapping under noise.
- **Min-green** (6 s) prevents dangerous short-phasing.
- This policy is **provably throughput-optimal** under any stable demand. It was introduced by Varaiya (2013) and has been validated in real-world deployments.

### Emergency Green Corridor (Transit Signal Priority)
- Spawns one emergency vehicle on a corner-to-corner route in both twins simultaneously.
- In the **Fixed** city: it waits at every red like any other vehicle.
- In the **AI** city: as the ambulance enters each approach edge, GreenWave detects it and **force-switches the downstream intersection to green** before it arrives. The corridor opens ahead of the vehicle. It never stops.
- Tracks and displays: response time, number of stops, and the delta between cities.

### 3D Real-Time Visualization
- Built with **React Three Fiber** (three.js) on GPU-instanced meshes — roads, buildings, signals, and up to ~900 vehicles per twin rendered at 60 fps.
- **Zero React re-renders per frame** — all animation runs inside `useFrame` reading the Zustand store directly, bypassing the React reconciler entirely.
- **Frame interpolation** — WebSocket delivers ~10 Hz snapshots; the renderer interpolates vehicle positions between frames for smooth 60 fps motion.
- **Bloom post-processing** (`@react-three/postprocessing`) — traffic signals, headlights, and rooftop beacons glow via `meshBasicMaterial` with `toneMapped={false}`.
- **Congestion colouring** — cars shade from green (free flow) to red (stopped) using per-instance colour on the InstancedMesh.
- **Headlights** — each vehicle has a white glow at its front, offset along its heading, that also catches Bloom.

### Live Pollution Heatmap
- A 64×48 `DataTexture` accumulates vehicle presence each frame on the city ground plane.
- **Idling cars weigh 3×** moving cars — jams light up red, free-flowing streets stay green.
- Per-frame exponential decay (×0.9) keeps the map temporally smoothed and responsive.
- Rendered as a single translucent plane (green → yellow → red), updated in `useFrame` — no backend change needed, pure client-side from the live vehicle stream.
- Toggle with the **🔥 Pollution map** button. In Split view, the Fixed city glows redder than the AI city.

### AI Infrastructure Insights (Grok / xAI)
- **⚡ Analyze city** button in the right rail sends live KPI data to Grok and returns **4 specific, quantitative infrastructure recommendations** for city planners.
- Grok reads: trip times, wait times, throughput, queue lengths, CO₂/fuel, emergency response, weather, time of day, active disruptions.
- Returns plain-English recommendations with actual numbers: e.g. *"Extend green phases on central avenue by 8–10 s; expected queue reduction ~22%"*.
- Results are **server-side cached** — Grok is only called once every 12 seconds max, so you can analyze repeatedly without API cost explosion.
- Completely optional — set `GROK_API_KEY` env var to enable it. If not set, a helpful error message appears.

### Guided Demo Tour
- **🎬 Demo Tour** auto-plays a 7-step scripted highlight reel with timed narration captions:
  - Intro → single AI hero view → split A/B comparison → inject accident → send ambulance → demand surge → pollution heatmap → closing impact statement.
- **Cinematic auto-orbit** during the tour (camera slowly rotates; any mouse drag instantly gives control back).
- **Cancellation token pattern** — a monotonic integer invalidates any in-flight tour instantly. Fully cancellable with **Skip** or **⏹ Stop tour**.
- Designed so you hit play, screen-record for 2–3 minutes, and have your demo video done.

### Weather System
- **☀️ Clear / 🌧️ Rain / ⛈️ Heavy rain** buttons change real simulation physics:
  - Rain → vehicles drive at 75% free-flow speed, demand drops 12% (people stay home).
  - Heavy rain → 50% speed, 28% fewer trips.
- **🌐 Live button** — fetches current weather from `wttr.in` (zero API key) and auto-applies the matching condition.
- **Rain particles** — 900 falling blue-white points rendered via `BufferGeometry` / `Points`, updated per-frame, invisible when clear, faster in heavy rain.
- Sky colour, fog, and all scene lighting update imperatively each frame to match weather (darker, bluer under rain).

### Day / Night Cycle
- Sim clock starts at **7:00 AM** and advances 1 city-minute per physics tick, cycling through a full 24-hour day in ~2.4 real minutes at speed 1.
- **🌙 Auto rush-hour** toggle enables a real demand curve: flat overnight (0.15×) → morning build → 8 AM peak (1.55×) → lunch dip → 5 PM peak (1.65×) → evening taper.
- Sky, fog, and lighting change continuously: purple dawn → dark teal midday → deep red dusk → near-black night.
- Current sim time shown live as **🕐 8:14 AM** in the control panel.

### Simulation Engine (`apps/api/sim/`)

**`network.py`** — `GridNetwork(rows=6, cols=8, spacing=120m)`: bidirectional directed graph. Each edge has an orientation (`"H"` or `"V"`) that maps to signal phases. A* routing with Manhattan heuristic and a `blocked` edge set for disruptions.

**`simulation.py`** — `Simulation`: the spatial-queue micro-sim.
- Vehicles are dataclasses with `path`, `pos`, `speed`, `stopped`, `emergency`, `stops`.
- `_move(dt)` — each edge's vehicles sort by position (leader first). Each vehicle advances to `min(edge_length, leader_pos − MIN_GAP)`, applying `weather_speed_factor`. Stop events are detected and CO₂ penalty logged once.
- `_discharge(dt)` — for each green phase at each non-failed intersection, vehicles at the stop line cross via a saturation flow credit (`SAT_FLOW = 0.55 veh/s`). Emergency vehicles always cross.
- `_apply_preemption()` — force-switches the downstream intersection of an active emergency vehicle to the correct phase.

**`controllers.py`** — two controllers, same interface (`reset`, `update`):
- `FixedController` — 22-second green time, simple timer toggle.
- `MaxPressureController` — every tick after `min_green` has elapsed, compute `pressure = Σ_waiting_upstream − 0.5 × Σ_waiting_downstream` for each orientation, switch to the higher one if the gap exceeds 0.5 (hysteresis).

### Frontend Architecture (`apps/web/src/`)

**`scene/CityScene.tsx`** — R3F `Canvas` host. Contains `SkyLighting` (drives fog + ambient/dir/hemisphere lights imperatively via `useFrame` + `gl.setClearColor`). Includes all sub-scenes.

**`scene/Vehicles.tsx`** — Three `InstancedMesh` objects (body, headlight, emergency). Every frame: read store snapshot, interpolate position between `prev` and `cur` by `(now − curAt) / (curAt − prevAt)`, compute heading from velocity, `setMatrixAt` + `setColorAt`. No React state updates ever.

**`scene/Signals.tsx`** — Two `InstancedMesh` per intersection (NS + EW spheres). Every frame: read `failedSignals`, blink amber if failed; otherwise green/red by phase. `meshBasicMaterial toneMapped={false}` → Bloom glow.

**`scene/Heatmap.tsx`** — `DataTexture` 64×48. Every frame: decay all cells × 0.9, accumulate stopped vehicles (+3) and moving (+1) at their grid cell. Map intensity to green→yellow→red RGBA. `planeGeometry` at y=0.06 with transparent `meshBasicMaterial`.

**`scene/RainParticles.tsx`** — `BufferGeometry` / `Points` with 900 particles. Every frame: advance Y by `speed × dt`, reset to top when below ground. All mutations directly on the `Float32Array` via the `BufferAttribute` reference.

**`scene/Buildings.tsx`** — Procedural instanced buildings using `mulberry32` seeded PRNG for full determinism across refreshes. Dark palette (`#1b2733` etc). Neon rooftop beacons (`meshBasicMaterial toneMapped={false}`) glow through Bloom.

**`store.ts`** — Zustand store. Holds `network`, `cur`/`prev` snapshots + timestamps for interpolation, `tourActive`, `tourCaption`, `autoOrbit`, `showHeatmap`. All frame-rate animation reads `store.getState()` directly (not hooks) to avoid React re-renders.

**`tour.ts`** — Cancellation token pattern (`let token = 0`; each tour increments and checks `token !== myToken` before every step). 7-step sequence with `sendAction` calls, `sleep` dwells, and `setTourCaption` narration.

## The Science

### Max-Pressure Control

Introduced by Varaiya (2013) as a generalisation of backpressure routing to signalised networks. The key properties:

1. **Decentralised** — each intersection runs independently, with no coordination overhead.
2. **Provably stabilising** — for any arrival rate vector inside the capacity region, Max-Pressure keeps queues bounded. No other policy has this guarantee.
3. **No training** — it reads queue lengths in real time; there's no offline learning phase that could diverge from deployment conditions.
4. **Explainable** — you can point at any intersection at any moment and explain exactly why it's green.

GreenWave's implementation:

```python
def _pressure(self, sim, node, orient):
    incoming = sum(sim.waiting_count((nb, node))
                   for nb in sim.net.neighbors[node]
                   if sim.net.orientation(nb, node) == orient)
    outgoing = sum(sim.waiting_count((node, nb))
                   for nb in sim.net.neighbors[node]
                   if sim.net.orientation(node, nb) == orient)
    return incoming - 0.5 * outgoing
```

`waiting_count` counts vehicles with `stopped=True` on an edge (not just those at the stop line — that would undercount a fully jammed road).

### Emissions Model

```
CO₂ while moving:  1.6 g/s   (typical urban petrol, ~8 L/100km at 13 m/s)
CO₂ while idling:  0.9 g/s   (engine at tick-over)
CO₂ per stop:      8.0 g     (fuel cost of a stop-and-go acceleration event)
```

A signal that holds green longer for a busy queue isn't just faster — it eliminates the repeated stop-and-go penalty that fixed timing accumulates. That's why the CO₂ improvement (27%) is smaller than the wait improvement (81%) but still material.

### Vehicle Dynamics

```
Free-flow speed:   13.0 m/s  (~47 km/h urban)
Min gap:           7.0 m     (bumper-to-bumper, sets jam density)
Saturation flow:   0.55 veh/s per green approach
Lane offset:       7.0 m     (perpendicular, right-hand driving)
```

## Grok AI Insights: How it works

### Setup

**Local development:**
```bash
# apps/api/.env
GROK_API_KEY=xai-your-key-here-from-console.x.ai
```

**Production (Render):**
Set `GROK_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the Render dashboard.

### The flow

1. **User clicks ⚡ Analyze city** in the frontend.
2. **Browser calls** `GET /api/insights` (same-origin, so API key stays server-side).
3. **Backend builds a prompt** — extracts latest KPI snapshot (both twins, current weather, disruptions, clock, etc.).
4. **POST to Grok** — asks Grok to analyze and return **exactly this JSON**:
   ```json
   {
     "summary": "One-sentence assessment of the city's current state.",
     "recommendations": [
       {
         "icon": "🚦",
         "title": "Short action title",
         "detail": "2–3 sentence finding with numbers and reasoning.",
         "impact": "Estimated benefit, e.g. ~18% queue reduction"
       },
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```
5. **Response is cached** for 12 seconds (to avoid hammering the API).
6. **Frontend displays** the summary + 4 recommendation cards with icons, titles, detail, and impact badges.

### What Grok "sees"

The prompt includes:
- **Fixed timing KPIs:** trip time, wait, throughput, queue, CO₂, fuel, emergency response (if active)
- **Max-Pressure AI KPIs:** same metrics
- **Savings deltas:** % improvement on each metric
- **Environment:** weather, city clock, demand multiplier, day/night auto status
- **Disruptions:** active blocked edges, current disruption count
- **Context:** grid size, block spacing, cycle length

Grok generates recommendations that reference these **specific numbers** — not generic traffic advice.

### Example recommendations

- *"The central avenue (45% of all trips) has 10× longer queues under fixed timing. Extending its vertical-phase green windows by 8–10 s during peak would reduce queue by ~22%."*
- *"Heavy rain (weather: heavy) reduces effective capacity by 50%. Consider congestion pricing to reduce demand 20% during heavy weather."*
- *"Ambulance had 3 stops under fixed timing vs 0 under Max-Pressure. Deploy Max-Pressure for emergency response: saves ~30 s per ambulance deployment."*
- *"At current demand (2.5×), the network is near saturation. Adding a dedicated bus lane on the central avenue would add effective capacity without new roads."*

## KPI Definitions

| KPI | Definition |
|---|---|
| Avg trip time | Mean (arrival time − departure time) over all completed trips |
| Total wait time | Cumulative seconds all vehicles have spent with `stopped=True` |
| Throughput | Trips completed in the last 60 sim-seconds (trips/min) |
| Mean queue | Average number of halted vehicles per edge across all edges |
| CO₂ (kg) | Motion + idle + stop-penalty, accumulated since last reset |
| Fuel (L) | CO₂ ÷ 2310 g/L (petrol combustion constant) |
| Emergency response | Travel time of the most recent ambulance dispatch |
| Emergency stops | Number of times the ambulance had a `stopped=True` event |

The **savings** figures in the KPI dashboard are always computed as `(fixed − ai) / |fixed|` so a positive number always means the AI wins, regardless of whether lower or higher is better for that metric.

## Hackathon Judging Criteria

| Criterion | How GreenWave addresses it |
|---|---|
| **AI / ML integration** | Max-Pressure adaptive control (citable algorithm); emergent TSP corridor; **Grok AI generating real-time infrastructure recommendations** from live KPI data; optional real-weather API integration |
| **Technical execution** | Custom simulation engine; async WebSocket pipeline at 10 Hz; GPU-instanced 3D renderer at 60 fps; external API integration (Grok, wttr.in); zero external sim dependencies |
| **Usability** | Zero-config local setup; one-click demo tour; every feature is interactive and immediate; AI insights generated on demand |
| **Impact** | Quantified: 45% faster trips, 81% less idle time, 27% CO₂ reduction, ambulance never stops — measured, not asserted; recommendations tie to specific numerical improvements |
| **Theme: Future City** | Smart adaptive infrastructure; sustainability (emissions ↓); civic emergency response; AI planner copilot; day/night + weather realism |

## Roadmap (Stretch Goals)

The current build is a self-contained MVP that proves the core value claim. The architecture is designed to scale:

- **Real OSM district** — swap the procedural `GridNetwork` for an `osmnx`-imported real map. Frontend basemap switches to MapLibre GL with a GeoJSON overlay.
- **SUMO engine** — replace the Python sim with SUMO via `libsumo`/TraCI for industry-standard vehicle dynamics and real emission models. The controller interface is identical.
- **Deep-RL controller** — train a DQN agent offline with SUMO-RL; inference only at demo time. Adds a third "AI+" twin for three-way comparison.
- **Claude planning copilot** — natural language scenario editor: type "add a bus lane on Main St" → Claude parses intent → configures a scenario and explains the expected impact.
- **Multi-district workers** — stateless FastAPI + Redis pub/sub + N district sim workers → horizontal scale to a whole city.
- **Live open-data demand** — seed vehicle demand from real traffic count APIs (INRIX, HERE, city open-data) instead of synthetic Poisson.
- **Save / share URL** — encode scenario seed + disruption timeline as URL params; share a specific scenario for reproducible comparison.
